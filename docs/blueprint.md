# **App Name**: AI Amigo

## Core Features:

- Role Selection Landing: Landing page with role selection (Brother, Friend, Girlfriend, Mother, Father) to set the AI persona.
- Chat UI: Chat interface mimicking WhatsApp, including profile photo, online status, typing indicator and message bubbles.
- AI Persona: AI persona engine: Adjusts tone, language, and style based on selected role using a reasoning tool to incorporate specific information from the prompt to help match tone, language, and style to role selected.
- Enhanced Input: Message input box with emoji picker, attachment button, and voice input option, and persistent keyboard focus.
- Custom Themes: User option for Light, Dark and AMOLED themes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#A64AC9), a non-cliche choice suggesting both technological sophistication and playful fun.
- Background color: Light purple (#F2E7FA), a very light, desaturated tint of the primary.
- Accent color: Pink (#E0BBE4), analogous to the purple primary, for a strong but harmonious contrast.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. 'Inter' is modern, machined, objective, and neutral, so it matches the technical elements of the app as well as leaving a friendly space for the user to project into.
- Use simple, clean icons that match the selected role's personality (e.g., hearts for 'Girlfriend,' books for 'Father').
- WhatsApp-like message bubbles for a familiar chat interface.
- Typing indicator and smooth scroll animations to enhance the chat experience.
